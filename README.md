Work in progress

This project will use Beautiful Soup to scrape Amazon web pages collecting the review and rating information.  The sentiment in the reviews will then be rated and compared to the overall star rating of the given product.

In doing so we can determine whether written reviews skew a certain way (more positive or negative) compared to the star-only reviews.
